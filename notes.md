## AWS Notes

I learned how to deploy a server and make it accessible through a custom domain. I researched the steps involved in deploying a server, configuring DNS settings, and linking it to a custom domain name. This involved setting up hosting, ensuring the server was running correctly, and testing that the domain pointed to the correct location. 

## HTML Notes

To complete this assignment, I needed to learn how to structure and build multiple HTML pages with proper elements and functionality. I familiarized myself with key HTML tags like title, header, nav, form, input, button, and footer to ensure each page had the right layout and interactive components. I also had to learn how to create navigation links to connect the pages and add external links, such as one to GitHub. I also explored how to incorporate a 3rd party API, including what options I had for which API to use, and how to integrate images into the pages.
