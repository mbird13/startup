## AWS Notes

I learned how to deploy a server and make it accessible through a custom domain. I researched the steps involved in deploying a server, configuring DNS settings, and linking it to a custom domain name. This involved setting up hosting, ensuring the server was running correctly, and testing that the domain pointed to the correct location. 

## HTML Notes

To complete this assignment, I needed to learn how to structure and build multiple HTML pages with proper elements and functionality. I familiarized myself with key HTML tags like title, header, nav, form, input, button, and footer to ensure each page had the right layout and interactive components. I also had to learn how to create navigation links to connect the pages and add external links, such as one to GitHub. I also explored how to incorporate a 3rd party API, including what options I had for which API to use, and how to integrate images into the pages.

## CSS Notes

I learned how to style and format a webpage using CSS to achieve a polished and responsive design. I learned about how to style the header, footer, and main content elements, changing background colors and adjusting borders to improve the layout. For the navigation elements, I learned how to remove default styling from list items and add hover effects. I also explored how to make the webpage responsive by adjusting font sizes and page layout using CSS media queries to accommodate different window sizes. To improve the look of form elements and buttons, I learned how to work with the flex display mode.

For consistency across the pages, I imported external fonts to achieve a uniform look and updated the color of various text elements for better contrast and readability. Additionally, I worked on styling images by adjusting their sizes for different screen sizes and rounding their edges.

Viewport meta tag: used to tell the browser not to zoom in the content for small screens  
Display types: none, block, inline, flex, grid  
Flex: (grow) (shrink) (basis)  
@media tag: applies different css rules based on a trigger
