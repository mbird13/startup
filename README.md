# Find My Meal

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever been stuck trying to decide what to make for dinner? Maybe you don't have much time and just want to be given a recipe that fits your schedule. This site is the perfect answer. Just select how much time you have and what kind of meal you want to make and wait for the perfect recipe to be selected for you. As you use the site, you can even keep track of your favorite meals that you've tried for easy access at any time. There's no need to stress over your meal choices ever again.

    - login/logout
    - retrieving list of favorite recipes
    - adding new favorites
    - external call to get recipes based on preferences
